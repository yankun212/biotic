- This project contains the source code from the manuscript."The different biotic associations among rhizosphere microbial communities affected the tolerance of male and female poplar under salt stress "

- Documents ended with **.R** are the main R script for the corresponding analyses. Those ended with **.py** are the main python script for the corresponding analyses. Those ended simply with **.pyc** are required functions for python. Those ended simply with **.r** are required functions for R. Those ended with **.csv**, **.tre**, **.txt** etc. are required datasets.

- "iDIRECT" This folder contains the method code described in Part 2.4 of the manuscript.
 Ecological association network is obtained by filtering based on co-occurrence network.

- "QCMI" This folder contains the method code described in Part 2.4 of the manuscript.
 Biotic association network is obtained by filtering based on ecological association network.

- "code.R" contains the main codes of this study. "hub_node.r" is a necessary function for computing the hub node.

###The main code includes:
- networks: build co-occurrence network
- Fig.2i,j: Differences in community structure between groups as demonstrated by CPCoA and Adonis.
- Fig.3f: Filters keystone network nodes in the associated network         :
- Fig.4C: The contribution of environmental factors to microbial community construction.
- Fig.5: SEM
- Fig.S11: TITAN. Determine the threshold of microbial impact on the environment
